[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and releases are tagged
`vX.Y.Z`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-22

Push notifications are now on by default — once you allow notifications, Armada
keeps them enabled automatically across reloads and devices, so you don't have
to turn them back on.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22

The desktop app is now a true standalone client — it isn't tied to any single
server. Add whatever servers you want; nothing is baked in. It also gains a
system tray (close to tray, an unread badge, and launch-minimized) and screen
sharing on desktop.

### Added
- Standalone desktop app: a fresh install starts with no servers and a welcome
  screen to log in and add your own — your client, your servers.
- System tray on desktop: closing the window keeps Armada running in the tray,
  with a Show/Quit menu, an unread badge, and the option to launch minimized.

### Fixed
- Screen sharing now works in the desktop app, with a picker to choose which
  screen or window to share.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-22

A maintenance release fixing the Windows desktop build image in CI. No
user-facing changes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-22

A maintenance release that gets the desktop (Linux/Windows) installers building
in CI. No user-facing changes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

The first tagged release of Armada — a sovereign harbor on the open relays, with
servers, channels, and voice. This release brings push notifications and native
desktop apps alongside the existing mobile app, so you stay reachable wherever
you are.

### Added
- Push notifications for messages, mentions, replies, reactions, and direct
  messages — delivered straight from your own server, so you get pinged even
  when Armada is closed. Choose exactly what you're notified about in Settings,
  Discord-style.
- Desktop apps for Linux and Windows (with a manual macOS build), published
  alongside the Android app on every release.
- End-to-end-encrypted voice for Concord communities, plus a redesigned in-call
  stage: screen sharing with a focus/spotlight mode and a theater layout.
