// End-to-end tests drive a real Chromium against the dev server. They are NOT
// part of `npm run test` (tsc + eslint + vitest + build) and NOT in CI yet: a
// browser download and a live dev server don't belong in the unit gate, and CI
// runs on a maintainer-managed `act` image with a fixed time budget. Run them
// with `npm run test:e2e`.
//
// The fake-media flags are load-bearing. Without a real display to capture,
// Chromium's getDisplayMedia would block on the OS surface picker forever in
// headless CI. `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` auto-accepts the picker and
// `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream` supplies a synthetic surface, so a
// capture can complete with no human and no hardware. (The screen-share spec
// additionally stubs getDisplayMedia itself, but a future spec that doesn't
// still wants these.)
//
// The dev server runs on a DEDICATED port, not the app's usual 8080. Armada is
// a Ditto fork, so an Armada or Ditto `npm run dev` a developer already has
// open sits on 8080 too — and `reuseExistingServer` would then attach the whole
// suite to that unrelated app, whose SPA fallback answers every `/e2e/*`
// request with its own index.html, so the harness module never loads and every
// spec times out on `window.__screenShareHarness`. `--strictPort` makes Vite
// FAIL if the dedicated port is taken rather than silently drift to another
// (which would leave `url` pointing at nothing), so a collision is loud.
