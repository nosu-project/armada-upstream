/**
 * Fetch all groups hosted on a server (relay).
 *
 * Group metadata events (kind 39000) MUST be signed by the relay's own key.
 * When the relay advertises that key via NIP-11 (`self` or `pubkey`), the
 * query filters by `authors` so forged metadata from other publishers is
 * never trusted.
 *
 * Relays may hide closed/private groups from open-ended listings, so the
 * ids remembered in the user's kind 10009 list are queried explicitly by
 * `d` tag and merged in.
 *
 * The channel list is one of the most STABLE things in the app: it's
 * relay-signed metadata that changes only when an admin creates/edits/deletes
 * a channel. So this query is deliberately quiet — no polling, a long
 * staleTime, an IndexedDB seed so it renders instantly on reload, and explicit
 * invalidation (see useGroupModeration / useCreateGroup) for the rare real
 * changes. The query KEY is just the relay URL: `relaySelf` and the remembered
 * ids are read inside the queryFn for filtering, but kept OUT of the key so a
 * resolving NIP-11 doc or a churning kind-10009 list can't swap the cache
 * entry and force a refetch from scratch.
