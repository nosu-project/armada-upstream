/**
 * Transport-agnostic chat contracts.
 *
 * The chat UI (timeline, message rows, composer) is 100% presentational and
 * derives entirely from these types. A "transport" supplies the data and the
 * mutation callbacks; the shared components never touch a relay, a NIP-29 hook
 * or Concord's sealed envelopes directly. NIP-29 group chat and Concord
 * (end-to-end-encrypted communities) each implement a transport that satisfies
 * this contract, so they render through exactly the same components.
 *
 * Capabilities are optional: a feature's control renders only when the
 * transport provides the matching callback. A transport that can't pin (or
 * thread, or edit) simply omits that method and the UI hides the control —
 * there are no dead/disabled buttons.
