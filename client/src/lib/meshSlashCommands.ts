 * Slash commands that make sense on the Bluetooth mesh. The mesh has no

 * rewrites plus `/mention`, which just opens the `@` picker.
 *
 * Execution itself is the shared `executeSlashCommand` runner in
 * `slashCommands.ts` — this module only declares which commands the mesh
 * surface exposes (used both as the menu `commandFilter` and the runner's
 * `isAllowed` gate, so typed and picked commands agree).
