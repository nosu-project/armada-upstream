# Deploy a directory as an nsite so that no single Blossom mirror can fail it.
#
# Usage: nsite-deploy.sh <dir> [extra `nsyte deploy` args, e.g. --name X --no-config]
#
# Environment:
#   NSYTE_BUNKER            required — the nbunksec NIP-46 session that signs
#   NSITE_CONFIG            relays/servers source, default .nsite/config.json
#   NSITE_DEPLOY_ATTEMPTS   nsyte runs before giving up, default 2
#   NSITE_DEPLOY_TIMEOUT    seconds per run, default 420
#   NSITE_LOG_DIR           where the nsyte logs go, default $RUNNER_TEMP or /tmp
#
# Every workflow step that publishes an nsite goes through here rather than
# calling `nsyte deploy` itself, because nsyte's upload model is exactly wrong
# for a mirror outage: it runs one queue per server, gives each file on each
# server three 10 s attempts plus retries, and publishes the site manifest only
# once EVERY queue has drained. A server that is down — or, worse, up at the
# proxy and 5xx-ing behind it — therefore does not cost the deploy that
# server; it costs hundreds of files × ~90 s on that one queue, the step's
# deadline kills nsyte before the manifest is signed, and the two healthy
# servers' finished uploads are unreferenced blobs. The wrapper's job is to
# keep the run inside its deadline with the servers that are actually working:
#
#   failover   Hosts are probed (scripts/live-hosts.sh, a Blossom-level HEAD,
#              5xx counts as down) and only the live ones are handed to nsyte.
#              Each run is bounded by `timeout`, and a failed run is retried
#              WITHOUT the servers its log names as failing, so a server that
#              passed the probe and then rejected or stalled uploads is dropped
#              on the retry rather than allowed to fail it again.
#   mirroring  Every run is `--sync`: nsyte HEAD-checks every file of the site
#              on every server it was given and uploads the ones missing. That
#              is what backfills a server that was dropped, or down, during an
#              earlier deploy — without it nsyte transfers only files whose
#              hash changed since the last manifest, so a mirror that missed
#              one deploy would stay missing those blobs indefinitely.
#
# The servers nsyte is given are also the `server` tags it writes into the
# manifest (the hints gateways read), so a dropped server is not advertised
# for this deploy and is again the moment a deploy finds it healthy. That is
# also why this is one run over the live set rather than a primary pass plus
# a mirror pass: the manifest the second pass republished would name only the
# mirrors.
#
# Exit status: 0 when a manifest was published (nsyte's own rule — every file
# on at least one server and at least one relay accepted the manifest); 1 for
# nothing reachable, a zero-file scan, or every attempt failing.
