/**
 * ArmadaDB's SQLite engine, in Kotlin — a port of `src/lib/db/SqliteArmadaDB.ts`,
 * which carries the full rationale. See [ArmadaDbSchema] for the layout and for
 * why the tag index is an FTS5 inverted index rather than a b-tree.
 *
 * This is the ONE implementation on Android: the notification service writes
 * through it directly, and the WebView reaches the same instance over
 * `ArmadaDbPlugin`. There is no second engine to keep in step and no format to
 * agree on — the database logic is native, and the bridge is a transport.
 *
 * One connection, one database: every tenant shares the `rumors` /
 * `rumor_tags_fts` / `rumor_coords` tables, and the KV store is a fourth.
 *
 * Two things carry the whole design:
 *
 *  - **`seq`, the rowid, encodes time** (`created_at × 2²⁰ + n`). So `ORDER BY
 *    seq DESC` is `ORDER BY created_at DESC` for the table, for every b-tree
 *    index over it, and — the point of the exercise — for FTS5, which only ever
 *    yields rows in rowid order. `since`/`until` become a rowid range that FTS5
 *    pushes down into its own backwards walk of the posting lists.
 *  - **Tags are tokens.** A filter's tag terms, and its authors when a tag is
 *    already driving, become one MATCH expression: groups of alternatives,
 *    ANDed. FTS5 merges the groups' posting lists in C, so the cost is the
 *    length of the shortest group rather than the product of them all, and one
 *    rumor is one row of the index however many of its tags matched.
 *
 * Everything the index doesn't carry — kinds, and authors without a tag — is
 * tested on the `rumors` rows it finds, which costs a column read on a row that
 * was going to be fetched anyway. Filters naming no tag and no keyword are
 * driven by a b-tree instead, chosen by strfry's priority cascade:
 *
 *   ids → tags/search → pubkey+kind → pubkey → kind → the whole tenant
 *
 * Semantics, matching the IndexedDB adapter the web build still uses:
 *
 *  - Ephemeral kinds (20000–29999) are never stored.
 *  - Replaceable (0, 3, 10000–19999) and addressable (30000–39999) rumors
 *    supersede older versions at the same (tenant, kind, pubkey, d) coordinate;
 *    a stale write is skipped. NIP-01 tie-break: on equal created_at the smaller
 *    id wins.
 *  - NIP-09 kind-5 deletion requests are applied on write (`e` by id, `a` by
 *    coordinate), only against the requester's own rumors in the same tenant;
 *    the request itself is retained.
 *  - A batch of rumors commits as ONE transaction, across all tenants.
 *
 * THREADING: every public method takes [lock] for its whole duration. The
 * transactions here are plain `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` statements and SQLite has no
 * nested ones, so a second caller interleaving statements would have its work
 * swept into — and rolled back with — someone else's transaction. The lock is
 * reentrant, so a public method may call another.
