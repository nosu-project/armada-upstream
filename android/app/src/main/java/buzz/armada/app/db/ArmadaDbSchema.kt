/**
 * The SQLite schema behind [SqliteArmadaDb] — a statement-for-statement port of
 * `src/lib/db/sqliteSchema.ts`, which carries the full rationale. The two must
 * stay identical: the WebView and the notification service open the same file,
 * so a divergence here is a divergence in what either can read.
 *
 * The tag index is **an FTS5 inverted index, not a b-tree**. An event's tags are
 * flattened into a string of opaque tokens — `t1:e:<id>`, `t1:channel:<id>` —
 * and handed to FTS5 with a tokenizer configured so each one is a single
 * indivisible token. `{"#channel": [id]}` is then a full-text match for the word
 * `t<ord>:channel:<id>`.
 *
 * Ordering is arranged by construction rather than by a sorter: FTS5 only ever
 * yields rows in rowid order, so the rowid IS time —
 *
 *     seq = created_at × 2²⁰ + a per-second sequence number
 *
 * — which makes `ORDER BY seq DESC` newest-first for the table, for every
 * b-tree over it, and for the index, and turns `since`/`until` into a rowid
 * range FTS5 pushes down into its own backwards walk.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS: FTS5 of at least 3.43 (2023), for contentless tables that
 * support deletion. Android's platform SQLite lacks it on the versions Armada
 * supports, which is why [BundledSqlDriver] brings its own engine.

     * on `rumor_term_tenants` and so is indifferent to the version the file
