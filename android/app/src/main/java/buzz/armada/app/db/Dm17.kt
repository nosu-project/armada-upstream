 *
 * The background service decrypts DM gift wraps for its notifications anyway, so
 * it files the recovered rumor in the same per-viewer tenant the WebView reads
 * (`dm17:<self>`) rather than throwing it away and leaving the app to open the
 * wrap a second time. That only works if it obeys the same rules — otherwise the
 * two writers disagree about what a conversation contains.
 *
 * Pure and Context-free so the rules can be tested on the JVM without an
 * emulator; [ServiceStore.storeDm17Rumor] is the thin part that writes.
