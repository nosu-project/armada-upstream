/**
 * What the background relay service writes, and where.
 *
 * The service used to keep its own database (`armada-events.db`) with its own
 * flat schema, and the only way anything reached the app was a cursor drain the
 * WebView replayed into a second store. Now there is one store: the service
 * writes an event into the same tenant the WebView would have written it to, so
 * a message received while the app was dead is simply THERE on open — no replay,
 * no second copy, no format to keep in step.
 *
 * "The same tenant" is why [RelayScope] exists here as well as in the WebView:
 * NIP-29 data is stored per relay, and a rule only one of the two writers applies
 * is a disagreement about where a message lives.
 *
 * The drain survives, but only as ROUTING. Storing a message and acting on it
 * are different jobs: wire ingest is what parks undecryptable wraps, rings the
 * scopes that repaint a timeline, and feeds notification candidates. So every
 * event also lands in a per-relay handoff queue
 * ([ArmadaDb.serviceQueueTenant]), which the WebView reads and empties on
 * open/resume (peek+ack: a page is only removed once ingest has committed, so a
 * crash mid-drain replays rather than loses).
 *
 * Failures are logged and swallowed throughout. A notification that arrives
 * without its event having been persisted is a degraded notification; a service
 * that dies on a write error posts nothing at all.
