/// A tiny on-disk cache of sender avatars, in the App Group container.
///
/// It exists because of a constraint the other two platforms don't have. iOS
/// will only show a person's picture on a notification via a communication
/// notification, and the image has to be IN HAND when the extension hands its
/// content back — there is no URL the system will fetch on our behalf. So the
/// extension has to do the one thing this pipeline otherwise refuses to do and
/// touch the network, inside a budget measured in seconds, for every push.
///
/// Caching turns that into a per-sender cost rather than a per-message one: the
/// second message from someone is served from disk with no request at all. A
/// miss is never fatal — the notification simply shows the monogram iOS derives
/// from the sender's name, which is still the person rather than the app icon.
///
/// Keyed by the SHA-256 of the URL, so a profile that changes its picture
/// misses once and then caches the new one; nothing has to invalidate anything.
/// Hashing also keeps a remote string out of the filesystem: a URL can contain
/// a path separator, a `..`, or 4 KB of query, and none of that should be
/// deciding what file gets written.
///
/// The directory is a parameter rather than a lookup, so everything here — the
/// keying, the size cap, the eviction order — runs under `swift test` on Linux,
/// where an App Group container does not exist. Only `directory(appGroup:)`
/// needs a device.
