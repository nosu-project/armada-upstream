/// ArmadaDB's SQLite engine, in Swift — a port of `src/lib/db/SqliteArmadaDB.ts`
/// by way of `SqliteArmadaDb.kt`, which carry the full rationale. See
/// `ArmadaDbSchema` for the layout and for why the tag index is an FTS5
/// inverted index rather than a b-tree.
///
/// This is intended to be the ONE implementation on iOS, as its Kotlin twin is
/// on Android: the WebView reaches it over `ArmadaDbPlugin`, and a notification
/// extension would write through it directly, against the same file. There is
/// no second engine to keep in step and no format to agree on — the database
/// logic is native, and the bridge is a transport.
///
/// One connection, one database: every tenant shares the `rumors` /
/// `rumor_tags_fts` / `rumor_coords` tables, and the KV store is a fourth.
///
/// Two things carry the whole design:
///
///  - **`seq`, the rowid, encodes time** (`created_at × 2²⁰ + n`). So `ORDER BY
///    seq DESC` is `ORDER BY created_at DESC` for the table, for every b-tree
///    index over it, and — the point of the exercise — for FTS5, which only
///    ever yields rows in rowid order. `since`/`until` become a rowid range
///    that FTS5 pushes down into its own backwards walk of the posting lists.
///  - **Tags are tokens.** A filter's tag terms, and its authors when a tag is
///    already driving, become one MATCH expression: groups of alternatives,
///    ANDed. FTS5 merges the groups' posting lists in C, so the cost is the
///    length of the shortest group rather than the product of them all, and one
///    rumor is one row of the index however many of its tags matched.
///
/// Everything the index doesn't carry — kinds, and authors without a tag — is
/// tested on the `rumors` rows it finds, which costs a column read on a row
/// that was going to be fetched anyway. Filters naming no tag and no keyword
/// are driven by a b-tree instead, chosen by strfry's priority cascade:
///
///   ids → tags/search → pubkey+kind → pubkey → kind → the whole tenant
///
/// Semantics, matching the IndexedDB adapter the web build still uses:
///
///  - Ephemeral kinds (20000–29999) are never stored.
///  - Replaceable (0, 3, 10000–19999) and addressable (30000–39999) rumors
///    supersede older versions at the same (tenant, kind, pubkey, d)
///    coordinate; a stale write is skipped. NIP-01 tie-break: on equal
///    created_at the smaller id wins.
///  - NIP-09 kind-5 deletion requests are applied on write (`e` by id, `a` by
///    coordinate), only against the requester's own rumors in the same tenant;
///    the request itself is retained.
///  - A batch of rumors commits as ONE transaction, across all tenants.
///
/// THREADING: every public method takes `lock` for its whole duration. The
/// transactions here are plain `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` statements and SQLite has no
/// nested ones, so a second caller interleaving statements would have its work
/// swept into — and rolled back with — someone else's transaction. The lock is
/// reentrant, so a public method may call another.
