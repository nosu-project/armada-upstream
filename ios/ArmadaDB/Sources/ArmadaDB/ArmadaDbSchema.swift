/// The SQLite schema behind `SqliteArmadaDb` — a statement-for-statement port
/// of `src/lib/db/sqliteSchema.ts`, which carries the full rationale, by way of
/// `ArmadaDbSchema.kt`. All three must stay identical: on Android the WebView
/// and the notification service open the same file, on iOS the WebView and (in
/// time) the notification extension will, and a divergence here is a divergence
/// in what either can read.
///
/// The tag index is **an FTS5 inverted index, not a b-tree**. An event's tags
/// are flattened into a string of opaque tokens — `t1:e:<id>`,
/// `t1:channel:<id>` — and handed to FTS5 with a tokenizer configured so each
/// one is a single indivisible token. `{"#channel": [id]}` is then a full-text
/// match for the word `t<ord>:channel:<id>`.
///
/// Ordering is arranged by construction rather than by a sorter: FTS5 only ever
/// yields rows in rowid order, so the rowid IS time —
///
///     seq = created_at × 2²⁰ + a per-second sequence number
///
/// — which makes `ORDER BY seq DESC` newest-first for the table, for every
/// b-tree over it, and for the index, and turns `since`/`until` into a rowid
/// range FTS5 pushes down into its own backwards walk.
///
/// REQUIREMENTS: FTS5 of at least 3.43 (2023), for contentless tables that
/// support deletion, and the JSON1 extension. Apple's platform SQLite has
/// neither on the iOS versions Armada supports, which is why `SqliteDriver`
/// brings its own engine.
