 * foreign origin and kicked out to the system browser (there is no OS-level

 * route it through the renderer's router instead of shell.openExternal.
 *
 * `host` is the renderer's build-time App Links host (`VITE_PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN`),
 * registered over IPC — it is not known to the main process otherwise. This
 * mirrors `pathFromDeepLinkUrl`'s https branch (lib/deepLinkUrl.ts) exactly:
 * https only, exact host, a real router path (a leading `//` is a
 * protocol-relative URL naming another origin, not a path), never bare `/`.
