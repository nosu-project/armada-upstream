/**
 * Effect-verification for the Concord channel sidebar's per-row mount cost.
 *
 * A Concord room ↔ DMs switch remounts the whole page (AppRouter has no
 * keepalive), so the channel sidebar mounts every `ChannelRow` synchronously in
 * one React commit. A CPU profile of that switch was dominated by TanStack
 * Query observer creation/subscription; each `ChannelRow` used to stand up a
 * `useVoiceBroker` query purely to pre-warm the join click, so N channels meant
 * N query observers created in that single commit — and the channel list is not
 * viewport-gated (its rows are drag-reorder targets measured out of the DOM),
 * so nothing bounded N.
 *
 * The broker is only ever consumed by the join handler, which already resolves
 * it lazily (`resolveVoiceBroker`) when the row hands it `null`. So the row need
 * not carry the query at all. This test pins that: the sidebar mounts ZERO
 * broker query observers, while STILL subscribing presence per row (the live
 * "someone's in a call here" indicator, which genuinely is per-channel and is
 * already coalesced to one REQ per relay under the hood).
 *
 * The data hooks are stubbed to counting spies so the assertion is about which
 * observers each row stands up, isolated from the query/relay stack.
