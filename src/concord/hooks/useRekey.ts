/**
 * Watch each held Private Channel's NEXT-epoch rekey address (CORD-06 §2:
 * "per PRIVATE Channel you hold; the NEXT channel-epoch's rekey address") and
 * react per channel, mirroring {@link useRekeyWatch}'s base logic:
 *
 *   - a complete, authorized, continuity-checked rotation carrying MY blob →
 *     adopt the channel's new key/epoch (scope-bound inside the ciphertext,
 *     so a blob minted for one channel can never splice into another);
 *   - a complete rotation with NO blob for me, published at/after I joined →
 *     I've been removed from the channel: it is dropped from `current` so it
 *     visibly disappears (§2 "the client then either visibly removes them or
 *     switches to the new keys"); the original key survives in `seed`.
 *
 * Addresses derive from the community_root, and a Refounding seals its
 * channel rekeys under the PRIOR root (§3) — so a member who adopted the base
 * rotation first would derive the wrong address from their fresh root alone.
 * Every held root is therefore watched, and adoption chains: each adopted
 * channel epoch re-keys the query at `epoch + 2`, walking forward across any
 * number of missed rotations.
 *
 * Authority follows CORD-06: a single-channel Rekey requires MANAGE_CHANNELS,
 * a Refounding's channel rotations act under BAN, and the owner outranks all —
 * any of the three is honored; a banned rotator never is.
