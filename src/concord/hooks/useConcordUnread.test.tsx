/**
 * The unread badge must agree with what the reader actually SEES. The trap this
 * guards: the badge scans the raw rumor store, but the timeline render folds
 * kind-5 deletes — and the store's NIP-09 only removes a delete's target within
 * one write batch, so a self-delete a relay delivered a beat after its target
 * leaves that target physically cached (chat.ts:302-308). A self-deleted NEWEST
 * message would then pin `latest` above every rendered row: a badge no channel
 * open can ever clear, because clear-on-open stamps the newest UNDELETED row.
 * (Observed live in a #ditto channel: a ".." posted and deleted 5s later left
 * the room unread for every member but its author until someone else posted.)
