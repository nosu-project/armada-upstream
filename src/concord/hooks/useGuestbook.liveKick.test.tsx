/**
 * The KICK live-delivery path, end to end through the real chain — a regression
 * guard for the bug that made a kick take "at least a minute" on both sides and
 * ~20s longer to actually remove the kickee.
 *
 * A kick rotates no key and publishes no control edition, so its ONLY prompt
 * delivery is the wire's standing `c2gb` subscription: a guestbook wrap is
 * ingested (`ingestWireEvents`) into the opened-event store and rings
 * `c2gb:<idHex>`; `useGuestbook` listens on that scope and re-reads.
 *
 * THE BUG had two halves, both from the guestbook query conflating a store read
 * with a network sweep — where the control plane keeps them separate:
 *
 *   - `useControlEvents` (useControlPlane.ts): the `c2ctl` bus wake runs a PURE
 *     STORE READ (`queryPlane` → `setQueryData`), and its `queryFn` is a pure
 *     store read too, with the sweep on a SEPARATE effect. The edition ingest
 *     just wrote surfaces with no network.
 *   - `useGuestbook` (before the fix): the `c2gb` wake called
 *     `invalidateQueries`, and the `queryFn` did `await sweepGuestbook(...)` — a
 *     NETWORK round-trip (NIP-42 auth gate + a 25s query timeout) — BEFORE it
 *     ever read the store. So (a) the member-list flip was stranded behind the
 *     sweep (both sides waited out the `refetchInterval: 60_000` tick), and
 *     (b) `useSelfRemove`'s confirming `guestbook.refetch()` — which gates the
 *     kickee's teardown on `isFetching` clearing — waited out the same sweep,
 *     the ~20s that remained on the kickee AFTER their member list had flipped.
 *
 * The fix makes the guestbook query match the control plane: the `c2gb` wake is
 * a store-only `setQueryData`, and the `queryFn` returns the store read while
 * the sweep runs in the BACKGROUND. Both tests below HOLD the sweep (a slow /
 * auth-gated relay) to prove neither half waits on it.
