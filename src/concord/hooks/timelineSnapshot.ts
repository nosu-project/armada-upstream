/**
 * The last painted window of a channel's timeline, persisted so a warm reload
 * paints before the key-derivation chain resolves (seeded from the route's
 * channel id on first render).
 *
 * - Seeded STALE, so the real store read still runs, and that read REPLACES the
 *   seed ({@link takeSnapshotSeed}) rather than merging into it: a row the store
 *   doesn't hold must not outlive the reload that restored it.
 * - Never holds an unsealed send: it was never a message, and `outgoing.ts`
 *   owns it until it is one.
 * - Never overwrites a populated cache (re-checked after the KV await).
 * - Rows filtered to their claimed channel id.
 * - Moderation is applied live by `foldTimeline`, not baked in.
 *
 * No new at-rest exposure (rumors are already stored decrypted); purged on logout.
 * SCOPED BY VIEWER, load-bearing: this cache is read before any key proves
 * membership, so without the pubkey key another account could read it.
