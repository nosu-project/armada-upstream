 * Every message in every channel of a community, merged into one feed (the

 * query. `active` gates the read so it doesn't contend with the open channel's
 * timeline read when the pane isn't on screen.
 *
 * Per-channel windows merge into a ragged tail (a busy channel reaches back
 * hours, a quiet one a year), so the feed is cut at the newest point where it is
 * COMPLETE: the latest oldest-row among truncated channels. `loadOlder` widens
 * the window so that watermark recedes; `hasMore` means "a channel was truncated".
 *
 * Each channel is folded on its own before the merge, since the flood detector
 * judges a batch as a cohort. Quarantined messages are dropped (as in Mentions),
 * not collapsed: this is an aggregate catch-up surface.
