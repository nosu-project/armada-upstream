/**
 * Visual flood suppression for the Chat Plane. Chat write access is key
 * possession (CORD-04 §1) and invite links are unlimited-use, so anyone can flood
 * a public channel. This only answers the RENDER question — which messages fold
 * into one expandable row. NOT a security boundary: nothing here drops a message
 * or feeds moderation; the Banlist remains the only author-identity drop.
 *
 * Shape rules bucket by CONTENT first (so 1×100 and 100×1 need one rule), with
 * near-duplicate clustering ({@link normalizeTokens}) because real campaigns
 * rotate templates. A message folds if ANY rule fires:
 *
 * 1. **Density** — one template {@link FLOOD_MIN_MESSAGES} times in
 *    {@link FLOOD_WINDOW_MS}, by ≤2 authors or all first-time authors.
 * 2. **Echo** — a substantial template {@link FLOOD_ECHO_MIN} times across
 *    ≥{@link FLOOD_ECHO_MIN_AUTHORS} keys in {@link FLOOD_ECHO_WINDOW_MS}.
 * 3. **Arrival burst** ({@link markArrivalBurst}) — many first-time keys at once.
 * 4. **Cohort** ({@link markCohortFlood}) — a crowd that arrived together and
 *    drowned the channel, content ignored.
 * 5. **Gibberish** ({@link markGibberish}) — one key posting low-originality noise.
 * 6. **Untrusted drown** ({@link markUntrustedDrown}) — keys the reader has no
 *    earned trust in ({@link computeTrusted}: reachable from the reader via
 *    replies/quotes/mentions) who together drown the channel. This closes the
 *    shape rules' arms race (established keys posting fluent, unique spam).
 *
 * Trusted authors (incl. self and staff) are exempt from every rule, so pasting a
 * regular's line folds only the spammer's copy.
