/**
 * Sybil flood against a public Concord channel — the threat, and what actually
 * blunts it.
 *
 * The property this file establishes first is a NEGATIVE one, because every
 * mitigation below is judged against it: chat write access is key possession
 * and nothing else (CORD-04 §1). A public community's invite link is
 * unlimited-use and carries the `community_root`, so `channelGroupKey` is
 * available to anyone who ever opened the link. An attacker mints keypairs for
 * free, seals under their own real key (which proves authorship, not
 * entitlement), wraps under the channel key, and every honest client decodes
 * and renders the result. `openOne` refuses splices and forged ids; it has no
 * opinion on WHO.
 *
 * That leaves the receiver as the only place a defense can live, so the
 * candidates here are pure functions over an already-opened batch. They are
 * deliberately NOT in `src/` yet — this file exists to measure them (spam
 * caught vs. honest messages harmed) before any of them earns a place on the
 * read path. Each returns rumor ids to QUARANTINE, never to drop: the fold's
 * only author-identity drop is the Banlist, and a heuristic must not quietly
 * become the second one.
 *
 * The content signals model attack shapes that have actually been observed on
 * open, membership-free public channels rather than imagined ones — the
 * nonce-suffix template below is a real campaign, and the false-positive corpus
 * the shape score is held back by is drawn from the same traffic. The framing
 * is deliberately different, though: with no membership at all such a channel
 * can only score content, and pays for it in hand-tuned regexes. Here the
 * author being unknown is a real signal, so content only ever breaks a tie.
 *
 * Read `an adaptive attacker` before building on any of this. Every membership
 * signal keys on the author being UNKNOWN, and an attacker who warms their keys
 * first is known — so these bound the cost of a naive flood and buy time, and
 * none of them is a defense against someone who has read them.
