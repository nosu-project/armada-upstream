 * Concord Control Plane — CORD-02 §5/§6/§9, CORD-04.

 * whose seals stay plaintext so a compaction can re-wrap signed editions
 * across epochs). Its stream key is SPLIT (CORD-01 Write-Restricted Streams):
 * the address-and-signer keypair derives from the staff-held `control_root`,
 * while the wraps' content is encrypted under the community_root-derived read
 * key every member holds — a spam gate, never authority. Epochs minted before
 * the split keyed the whole plane by the `concord/control` derivation alone,
 * retained here for reading them (CORD-02 §5).
 *
 * `foldControlState` replays the whole plane into current state in one pass:
 * the owner-rooted roster first (delegation fixpoint — the owner's rank comes
 * from the community_id itself, never from any fold), then every authority-
 * gated entity (metadata, channels, banlist, invite registries).

 *   2. then EVERY remaining edition, version-DESCENDING (equal versions by
 *      rumor id, the fold's tiebreak winner first) — the candidates a client
 *      may accept when (and only when) a higher-priority candidate fails the
 *      caller's authority gate. "The highest authority-verified head"
 *      (CORD-04 §1) requires gating before choosing, or a forger could
 *      suppress a legit entity with garbage at a higher (or dangling lower)
 *      version.
 *
 * Equal-version fork SIBLINGS are all kept: the tiebreak (lower rumor id) is
 * grindable, so evicting the loser here would let an id-mined fork of the
 * chain tip suppress the real edition before any authority gate ever saw it
 * (an unauthorized banlist fork emptying the banlist, a low-rank grant fork
 * revoking an admin). The tiebreak orders siblings; the gate decides.
 *
 * The caller picks the first candidate that passes its gate and records it in
 * `heads`.
 *
 * `floor` is a TRACKING client's last-accepted head for this entity (from the
 * prior fold's snapshot). When present and the served editions don't link
 * contiguously up to it (a hostile relay withholding the middle of the chain),
 * the fold reports a GAP: a synced client must fail closed and NOT downgrade to
 * the dangling head (CORD-04 §1). We drop every candidate strictly above the
 * floor in that case, so the entity holds at its last-known-good head and
 * refetches. A FRESH joiner (no floor) still accepts the highest head despite a
 * dangling `prev` — that is the legitimate compaction bootstrap.
 *
 * `snapshot` is the subset of editions wrapped under the CURRENT epoch's
 * control group, passed once the community has Refounded at least once. A
 * Refounding compacts every head into the new epoch (CORD-06 §3), so the
 * current epoch is self-contained and readable-but-superseded fragments from
 * older epochs must not outrank it. The snapshot folds by BOOTSTRAP
 * (highest signed version, floor as version-only refuse-downgrade), NEVER the
 * chain walk: behind a compaction, dangling `prev`s are normal, and — since
 * seal signatures survive re-wrap — any group-key holder can re-serve a real
 * OLD edition under the current group. Version anchoring is what bounds that:
 * a re-wrap cannot raise the version inside the signed seal, so a re-served
 * stale edition always loses to the compacted head. Old-epoch editions remain
 * fallback candidates for the authority gate.

 * Build the owner-dissolution tombstone rumor: chainless (no ev/ep/vac), empty
 * content, `eid` = the community_id. Published at `dissolved_pk`, a coordinate
 * derived from the community_id alone, so every member past or present
 * resolves it.
 *
 * The `eid` binds the tombstone to the community it kills, and MUST. The
 * dissolved plane's key derives from the community_id with no secret input, so
 * anyone holding that public id (it ships in every invite) can derive the
 * keypair, read the plane, and sign at it — the only thing an attacker lacks is
 * an owner-signed vsk-10 rumor. With the frozen §9 all-zero `eid` that rumor
 * names nothing, so an owner's genuine tombstone for community X can be lifted,
 * re-wrapped at the dissolved address of any OTHER community the same owner
 * runs, and kill it permanently — no membership, no keys, and no un-dissolve.
 * Committing the community_id makes a seal minted for X fail the check at Y.
