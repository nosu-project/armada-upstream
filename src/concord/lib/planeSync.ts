/**
 * Plane sweeps — the one fetch/decrypt/cursor discipline for a community's
 * kind-1059 planes (control, guestbook).
 *
 * - AUTH-GATED: REQs wait until stream keys are NIP-42-registered and their
 *   AUTHs acked by the relay (capped, so a stuck key can't stall sync).
 * - BATCHED: same-relay scopes share one REQ, one filter per scope with its own
 *   cursor/limit (per-filter isolation avoids the issue-#19 since-skip).
 * - SINGLE-FLIGHT: overlapping sweeps of a scope join the in-flight fetch.
 *
 * COMPLETE mode (Control): never a persisted forward cursor — it outlives
 * leave/ban/rejoin and epoch changes and would hide editions below it forever.
 * Instead the first sweep each session (and after floor age-out, truncation,
 * snapshot rebuild, exhaustive reads, or {@link markControlPlaneStale}) re-reads
 * the whole plane; sweeps between use a short-overlap `since` off a SESSION-only
 * floor (Concord wraps aren't backdated, CORD-01). A persisted seen-wrap memo
 * keeps repeat full sweeps decrypt-cheap.
 *
 * FORWARD mode (Guestbook): persisted `since` cursor, keyed by newest held epoch
 * so an epoch advance re-baselines with a full backfill.
 *
 * A sweep never claims it read everything (relay page sizes, dropped REQs and
 * withheld tails are indistinguishable). It reports only facts about itself —
 * `controlSweepTruncated`, `controlSweepQuorum` — and the fold judges its own
 * consistency via `FoldedControl.incomplete`.
