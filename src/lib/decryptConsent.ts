/**
 * The single, app-wide consent gate for bulk signer decryption.
 *
 * A cold client with a remote (NIP-46 bunker) or extension (NIP-07) signer is
 * one screen-load away from a "decrypt storm": opening a DM thread wants up to a
 * screenful of `nip04.decrypt` round-trips, the conversation list wants one per
 * peer, and the direct-invite inbox wants two `nip44.decrypt` per gift wrap —
 * each of which a bunker/extension may surface as its own approval prompt. Fired
 * eagerly on entry, that floods the signer before the user has asked for
 * anything.
 *
 * This module gates all of that behind ONE decision, made ONCE, remembered
 * globally:
 *
 *   - unset    → the first surface that needs a real (uncached) decrypt opens a
 *                single prompt; every concurrent caller awaits the SAME prompt
 *                (never a second dialog, never a second signer poke).
 *   - allowed  → decrypts proceed as normal, everywhere, forever.
 *   - declined → bulk decrypts are refused; the UI falls back to manual
 *                affordances ("Decrypt", "Decrypt all") so the user drives when
 *                the signer is touched.
 *
 * The decision is persisted in localStorage and shared across every surface and
 * tab. It is deliberately NOT per-conversation: the question ("do you want this
 * app decrypting with your signer?") is about the signer relationship, not any
 * one room, so it's asked once for the whole app.
 *
 * Cache interplay: a decrypt whose plaintext is already in the AppSigner
 * persistent cache never touches the signer, so callers should gate ONLY the
 * uncached remainder (see `useDirectMessages` / `useDirectInvites2`). When
 * everything is cached there is nothing to prompt about and the gate is skipped
 * entirely.
