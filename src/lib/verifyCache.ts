/**
 * Event verification that pays the Schnorr check ONCE per event id.
 *
 * Every non-wrap event a relay serves is Schnorr-verified synchronously in the
 * WebSocket message handler (~1–2ms each on a phone), and nothing deduped that
 * across relays or query rounds: a measured boot that stored ~2k unique events
 * received ~6k copies, so roughly two thirds of the main-thread crypto was
 * re-proving content already proven authentic. This memo makes verification
 * O(unique events) instead of O(copies received).
 *
 * The memo is sound because an event id IS the sha256 of the event's content:
 *
 *  - The claimed id is ALWAYS recomputed from the copy in hand first. The memo
 *    maps an id to "content hashing to this was verified", and the recomputed
 *    hash is the only thing binding THIS copy to that claim — without it, any
 *    content could ride a known-good id.
 *  - Only then may the Schnorr verify be skipped: an identical hash means
 *    identical content, and a valid signature over that content has already
 *    been seen. A duplicate copy carrying a MANGLED sig is thereby accepted —
 *    deliberately: the content is authentic regardless, and the stores strip
 *    `sig` before persisting (see mainEventStore), so the bad copy's sig
 *    outlives nothing.
 *  - A FAILED verify is never memoized, so a forged copy cannot poison the id
 *    for the honest copy that arrives later.
 *
 * The hash is recomputed per copy on purpose: sha256 of a ~1KB event is
 * microseconds against the Schnorr verify's milliseconds, and it is the whole
 * of the memo's security argument.
