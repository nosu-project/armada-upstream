/**
 * Tell the native background notification service which room(s) the WebView is
 * currently showing, so it can suppress redundant notifications for that room
 * (the live `relayEvent`/`concordMessage` feed already paints the message in
 * the timeline).
 *
 * The roomKeys are the service's stable per-conversation identifiers (the same
 * shapes `enqueueRoomMessage` uses on the Java side):
 *   - NIP-29 group: `h:<relayUrl>|<groupId>`
 *   - Concord V1:   `z:<pseudonym>` (one per held epoch)
 *   - Concord V2:   `c2:<channelIdHex>`
 *   - DM:           `dm:<peerPubkey>`
 *
 * Thread-level keys (`<roomKey>:t:<rootId>`) suppress notifications for a
 * specific open thread panel. Mentions still notify even on an active room.
 *
 * The service holds the keys only on its live instance, so killing the app or
 * the service immediately resumes notifications — no persistence, no TTL.
 *
 * Re-publishes on `visibilitychange` so backgrounding the app (document
 * hidden) clears the active set and foregrounding restores it. Native-only for
 * the background SERVICE; on web/desktop it also mirrors the keys into the
 * in-process active-room registry ({@link setWebActiveRooms}) so the page's
 * foreground notifier (`useForegroundNotifications`) suppresses notifications
 * for the conversation on screen the same way.
 *
 * @param roomKeys stable conversation identifiers the WebView is currently
 *                 showing. When empty/undefined, the active set is cleared.
