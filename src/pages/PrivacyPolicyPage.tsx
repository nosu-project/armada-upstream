            <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Overview</h2>
            <p>
              {APP_NAME} is a client application for the <strong>Nostr protocol</strong>, an open, decentralized
              communication network. This privacy policy explains how {APP_NAME} handles your data and what
              information is shared when you use the app.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">How Nostr Works</h2>
            <p>
              Nostr is a decentralized protocol. When you publish content, it is sent to one or more <strong>relays</strong> (independent
              servers) that you choose. {APP_NAME} does not operate these relays and has no control over data
              stored on them. Content published to Nostr relays is <strong>public by default</strong> and may be visible to anyone.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>{APP_NAME} is designed to minimize data collection. Here is what the app accesses:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Public key:</strong> Your Nostr public key is used to identify your account. It is not considered private information on the Nostr network.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Relay connections:</strong> The app connects to Nostr relays on your behalf to fetch and publish events. Relay operators may log connection metadata such as your IP address.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Local storage:</strong> Preferences, account information, and cached data are stored locally on your device. This data does not leave your device unless you explicitly publish it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Published events:</strong> Any content you publish (messages, reactions, profile updates, etc.) is sent to your configured relays and becomes part of the public Nostr network.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Private Keys</h2>
            <p>
              {APP_NAME} supports signing via browser extensions (NIP-07) and other external signers. When using
              these methods, your private key is managed by the signer and is <strong>never</strong> accessed or stored
              by {APP_NAME}. We strongly recommend using a browser extension or hardware signer to protect your
              private key.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Direct Messages</h2>
            <p>
              Direct messages on Nostr are encrypted between sender and recipient using the NIP-04 or NIP-44
              encryption standards. While message content is encrypted, metadata such as the sender and recipient
              public keys and timestamps are visible on relays. Concord communities use end-to-end encryption
              (CORD-02) so that even the relay hosting a community cannot read message content.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">File Uploads</h2>
            <p>
              When you upload files (images, videos, etc.), they are sent to Blossom-compatible file servers. These
              servers are operated by third parties and may have their own privacy policies. Uploaded files are
              generally publicly accessible via their URLs.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Voice Calls</h2>
            <p>
              Voice calls use LiveKit servers. For Concord communities, the voice broker issues a short-lived token
              bound to your pubkey; call media is encrypted in transit. For NIP-29 servers, the relay operator
              manages the LiveKit instance and its data handling.
            </p>

              <p>
                This deployment of {APP_NAME} uses privacy-friendly analytics (Plausible) to understand general
                usage patterns. These analytics are cookieless, do not track individual users, and do not collect
                personal information. The official {APP_NAME} apps (Android and desktop) ship with analytics

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The app may interact with the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
              <li><strong>Nostr relays:</strong> For reading and publishing events</li>
              <li><strong>Blossom servers:</strong> For file uploads and media hosting</li>
              <li><strong>LiveKit voice servers:</strong> For real-time voice calls</li>
              <li><strong>NIP-05 providers:</strong> For verifying Nostr addresses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each of these services is operated independently and may have its own data handling practices.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Data Removal</h2>
            <p>
              Because Nostr is a decentralized protocol, {APP_NAME} cannot guarantee the deletion of content
              once it has been published to relays. You can request deletion by publishing a Request to Vanish
              (NIP-62), but individual relays are not obligated to honor these requests. To clear local data, you
              can delete your account from Settings, which wipes all client-side persistence on this device.
