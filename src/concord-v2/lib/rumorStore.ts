/**
 * Concord V2 opened-event cache — the decrypted store for every plane.
 *
 * V2 traffic arrives as opaque kind-1059/21059 wraps (CORD-01). We never
 * persist those wraps anywhere: caching ciphertext is wasteful (every cold read
 * would re-run two NIP-44 opens and a Schnorr verify per event) and pollutes the
 * shared event cache. Instead we decrypt once on ingest and persist the
 * recovered rumor here — EXACTLY as its author wrote it — so the chat plane
 * reads back with an ordinary Nostr filter and no decrypt:
 *
 *   chat: store.query([{ kinds: [9], "#channel": [channelIdHex], limit }])
 *
 * Backed by ArmadaDB, ONE TENANT PER COMMUNITY (`c2:<communityIdHex>`) — a
 * separate physical database each, and separate from `armada-events`, so each
 * community's query engine, custom tag index, and NIP-09 deletion semantics stay
 * isolated.
 *
 * The per-community split is a SECURITY boundary, not a performance one. Every
 * read here is a tag query, and a tag is just data a keyholder wrote: the only
 * thing stopping a member of community A from publishing a rumor tagged with a
 * channel id belonging to community B — and having it served into B's timeline —
 * is application-level validation (`checkChannelBinding` on the chat path,
 * {@link writeOpened}'s refusal of any `channel` tag elsewhere). When every
 * community shared one store, a single bug in either check leaked across
 * communities. Now the tenant is chosen by the CALLER, from the community whose
 * keys it already holds, so a forged tag can at worst collide inside the
 * community that forged it. Defense in depth: the checks stay, and the storage
 * boundary means a lapse in them is contained.
 *
 * Community ids are stable — `sha256("concord/community" || owner_xonly ||
 * owner_salt)` (CORD-01 §A.4), with no epoch input — so a rekey or a Refounding
 * rotates stream keys WITHOUT moving the tenant. One database per joined
 * community, not one per epoch.
 *
 * The full signed SEAL is preserved too — the Control Plane re-wraps plaintext
 * seals verbatim across epochs during a compaction (CORD-02 §5 / `rewrapSeal`)
 * — but in ArmadaDB's KV, keyed by rumor id ({@link readStoredSeal}), NOT in
 * the stored rumor. A seal is not part of the rumor its author signed, and
 * serializing one into a tag value rewrites the very bytes the rumor id
 * commits to. It is also bulky and read by exactly one call site, so a
 * separate key is what it should have been: the row stays the rumor, and the
 * seal is fetched when a compaction actually needs it.
 *
 * Deletes ARE deletes: a kind-5 rumor written here triggers the store's NIP-09
 * pass, which physically removes the targeted event it authored. Moderator
 * deletes are authorized against the roster at the WRITE site (see `useChannel2`)
 * before the kind-5 rumor reaches the store.
 *
 * Trust note: this persists DECRYPTED plane data at rest — the same device-trust
 * level as the folded cache and the signer's decrypt cache, which already do.
 * Anyone with local storage access already holds the keys. Wiped on logout (see
 * purgeClientStorage).

// ── Pending raw-wrap holding store ──────────────────────────────────────────

// decrypt them — it has no stream keys. It parks the raw kind-1059/21059 wraps
// here (a SEPARATE tiny tenant) instead of the shared event cache; the
// WebView's plane hooks — which DO hold the keys — read them with
// {@link peekPendingWraps}, decrypt, and acknowledge ONLY the wraps that
// actually decoded with {@link ackPendingWraps}. A wrap is never deleted
// before its rumor is safely in the opened-event store: an aborted or failed
// decrypt round leaves it parked for the next read (a notified message must
// never be locally destructible — issue #19). Undecodable stragglers (e.g. a
// key never arrives) are pruned by age. So no 1059 ever lands in the `main`
// tenant, yet a notification's message survives a cold launch. Wraps
// are indexed only by their author (the stream address) so a plane can read
// exactly its own.
//
// Lives in its own ArmadaDB tenant. Wraps are stored WITHOUT their signature:
// a wrap is signed by a throwaway ephemeral key, `openWrap` never checks that
// signature, and everything authenticating the message is the seal sealed
// inside it — so there is nothing here to preserve.

 * The probe is what keeps this correct across restarts: wraps parked in a

 * so a session-scoped "was anything parked?" flag alone would hide them from
 * the drain forever — the native service's buffer was already drained, so
 * nothing re-parks them. One cheap `limit: 1` probe on the first peek finds
 * them; after that, the common web/desktop case (nothing ever parked) skips
 * IndexedDB on every subsequent peek, keeping the parked-wrap drain off the
