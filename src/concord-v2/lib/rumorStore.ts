/**
 * Concord V2 opened-event cache — the decrypted store for every plane.
 *
 * V2 traffic arrives as opaque kind-1059/21059 wraps (CORD-01). We never
 * persist those wraps anywhere: caching ciphertext is wasteful (every cold read
 * would re-run two NIP-44 opens and a Schnorr verify per event) and pollutes the
 * shared `armada-events` store. Instead we decrypt once on ingest and persist
 * the recovered {@link OpenedEvent} here — a signature-less event (`sig: ""`)
 * carrying its real kind / author / content / tags plus the plane provenance
 * (stream address, seal) folded into tags — so every plane reads back with an
 * ordinary Nostr filter and no decrypt:
 *
 *   chat:     store.query([{ kinds: [9], "#channel": [channelIdHex], limit }])
 *   control:  store.query([{ "#stream": [controlPk1, controlPk2, …] }])
 *
 * Backed by `@nostrify/indexeddb` (the strfry-port NStore), a SEPARATE database
 * from `armada-events` so its query engine, its custom tag index, and its NIP-09
 * deletion semantics stay isolated.
 *
 * The full signed SEAL is preserved (tag `seal`) because the Control Plane
 * re-wraps plaintext seals verbatim across epochs during a compaction (CORD-02
 * §5 / `rewrapSeal`). Chat never re-wraps, but stores the seal uniformly.
 *
 * Deletes ARE deletes: a kind-5 rumor written here triggers the store's NIP-09
 * pass, which physically removes the targeted event it authored. Moderator
 * deletes are authorized against the roster at the WRITE site (see `useChannel2`)
 * before the kind-5 rumor reaches the store.
 *
 * Trust note: this persists DECRYPTED plane data at rest — the same device-trust
 * level as the folded cache and the signer's decrypt cache, which already do.
 * Anyone with local storage access already holds the keys. Wiped on logout (see
 * purgeClientStorage).
