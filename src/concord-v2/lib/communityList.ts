 * The channel epoch a privatisation must mint at (CORD-03 §2): one past the

 * private. Monotonic and never resetting, so privatise -> publish -> privatise
 * leaves each generation at its own epoch — a stale key is always a LOWER one
 * and can never share a coordinate with the current key, which is what lets
 * the merge (epoch-max) and a `channel_cuts` floor (epoch-min) tell the
 * generations apart at all.
 *
 * `observedFloor` is the highest epoch a rotation was actually seen at
 * (`highestRotatedEpoch`, read off the CORD-06 §2 rekey addresses that derive
 * from the community root alone). It matters because the keys in hand are not
 * the channel's history: whoever privatises a public channel need never have
 * held an earlier generation — they joined after it was published, were never
 * granted its Role, or were rotated out and the `channel_cuts` floor dropped
 * the key from their list. Their empty keyring is not evidence that no
 * generation existed, so the higher of the two bounds wins.
