/**
 * Channel categories — an Armada client convention (see CORD.md).
 *
 * CORD-03 has no notion of grouping, so a Channel MAY carry
 * `custom["armada.category"] = { name }` — a display-only member of the same
 * client-extensible object as `armada.git` (CORD-02 §6).
 *
 * A category is EMERGENT, not an entity: it exists exactly as long as some
 * visible Channel names it. That is the whole design, and three properties
 * follow from it.
 *
 *   1. Nothing to keep in sync. There is no category list to create, delete,
 *      or garbage-collect, and no way to have a category pointing at a channel
 *      that no longer exists (or the reverse). Two moderators filing different
 *      channels at once collide on individual channels rather than clobbering
 *      a shared list — the reason CORD-04 keeps Role order per-entity.
 *
 *   2. A member sees a category exactly when they can see at least one channel
 *      in it, for free. `channelsView` already omits a private Channel whose
 *      key the member does not hold (CORD-03), so a category all of whose
 *      channels are gated away simply has no members left to derive it from.
 *      No separate visibility rule, and no way for the two to disagree.
 *
 *   3. An empty category cannot exist, so the sidebar can never show a member
 *      a heading whose contents are all hidden — which would advertise the
 *      existence of channels they cannot read.
 *
 * On (3), the honest bound: Channel METADATA lives on the Control Plane and is
 * readable by every member, gated content or not. Hiding the heading is a
 * display courtesy of the same kind as omitting the channel itself — a client
 * reading the fold directly still sees that the category exists. Categories
 * organize a sidebar; they are not an access control.

 *
 * There is no channel ordering yet — `channelsView` sorts by name — so today a
 * category sits where its ALPHABETICALLY first member puts it, which is not
 * something a community can choose. Nothing here changes when ordering lands.
 *
 * Uncategorized channels lead, unindented — a community that never files
 * anything sees exactly the flat list it had before.

 * channels disagreeing on case produce one heading, chosen deterministically
