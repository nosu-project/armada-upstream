/**
 * Who may read a Private Channel — CORD-03/04/06, no extension involved.
 *
 * CORD-03 defines the two channel kinds by exactly this question: a Public
 * Channel derives its key from the `community_root` and is "readable by every
 * member"; a Private Channel is "readable only by granted role-holders", its
 * key "an independent random secret, delivered on grant and rekeyed on
 * removal (CORD-06)". CORD-04 §2 carries the binding that names those
 * role-holders — a Role's `scope: {kind:"channel", channel_id}` — and CORD-06
 * §1 works the pair as its motivating example: "removing a role (`Tester`)
 * with access to a private channel (`#testers`)".
 *
 * So the roles scoped to a channel ARE its access list. Read access is still
 * enforced by key possession alone (CORD-04 §1) and nothing here grants it;
 * this is the routing that decides who a key is delivered TO on grant, and who
 * a rekey keeps on revoke. A client that ignores the routing cannot read
 * without the key, and a key holder can always leak — which is what the
 * rekey-on-revoke makes temporary.

 * than a public one (an independent key to deliver, rotate and lose, for the
 * audience the community root already covers), so clients should not create
 * it — but a channel arriving that way from elsewhere still reads correctly
 * here, and its existing key holders keep reading it.

/**
 * The held Private Channel keys an invite bundle may carry.
 *
 * CORD-05 §1 makes `channels` "the granted Channels" — the creator's CHOICE of

 * Channel is: CORD-03 §1 defines a Private Channel as "readable only by
 * granted role-holders", with its key "delivered on grant", and admits no
 * third kind of channel to land in. A bundle handing a key to someone holding
 * none of the Channel's scoped Roles (CORD-04 §2) makes that definition false
 * for every member — so entitlement is the ceiling, and `only`/`exclude`
 * narrow beneath it.
 *
 * That CORD-05 §6 gates a Direct Invite behind no permission ("any keyholder
 * can whisper keys") is about what the protocol can PREVENT, not about what a
 * client should hand over when a user clicks Invite. An unentitled recipient
 * is a leak whether or not the wire format could carry it.
 *
 * A roster that has not LOADED is a different thing from one that says
 * "entitled to nothing", so it throws rather than quietly vending nothing.
