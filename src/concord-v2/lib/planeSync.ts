/**
 * Plane sweeps — the ONE fetch/decrypt/cursor discipline for a community's
 * kind-1059 planes (control, guestbook), shared by the per-community hooks
 * and the global background sweep.
 *
 * - AUTH-GATED: holds every REQ until the scopes' stream keys are
 *   NIP-42-registered and (on a challenged socket) their AUTHs are ACKED by
 *   the relay, with a hard cap so a key that never registers can't stall
 *   sync. The ack is the relay's own `OK` — no settle-timer guesswork.
 * - BATCHED: same-relay scopes coalesce into one REQ (one filter per scope,
 *   each with its own cursor and limit — per-filter isolation prevents the
 *   issue-#19 since-skip).
 * - SINGLE-FLIGHT: overlapping sweeps of the same scope join the in-flight
 *   fetch instead of re-paying the full history.
 *
 * Two completeness modes, chosen per plane:
 *
 * - COMPLETE (Control): correctness-critical and compaction-bounded, so every
 *   sweep re-fetches the WHOLE plane — no `since`, paging past the relay's
 *   per-filter limit. A forward cursor here silently starves the fold: the
 *   cursor key outlives a leave/ban/rejoin and the held-epoch set it was
 *   minted under, so any edition below the high-water mark that was never
 *   ingested (an unban published while the client was out, a compaction
 *   re-wrap under a newly-held epoch) stays invisible forever — the client
 *   then folds a STALE banlist/roster and mis-renders membership. Repeat
 *   sweeps stay cheap: a session-scoped seen-wrap memo skips the re-decrypt,
 *   and `onFresh` fires only for wraps new to this session.
 * - FORWARD (Guestbook): append-mostly and unbounded, so it keeps the
 *   persisted `since` cursor — but the cursor scope is keyed by the newest
 *   held epoch, so an epoch advance (rejoin, rekey adoption) re-baselines
 *   with one full backfill instead of trusting a cursor minted under a
 *   different read scope.
