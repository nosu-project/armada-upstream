/**
 * Concord V2 disappearing messages — CORD-08.
 *
 * The timer is COMMUNITY state, never a per-message choice: one
 * `message_expiration` field (seconds; absent/0 = off) in the vsk-0 metadata
 * entity, edited like any versioned edition under MANAGE_METADATA. While set,
 * every durable chat-plane rumor carries a NIP-40 `expiration` of its send
 * time plus the timer, and the OUTER wrap carries the same tag so relays purge
 * the ciphertext itself (CORD-08 §2). Two chat kinds are exempt: deletes
 * (an expiring delete would let a longer-lived target come back) and the timer
 * notice itself (the notice documents the policy; the policy must not erase
 * it).
 *
 * Enforcement is the DM plane's trio (CORD-08 §3): ingest refusal + read
 * filter + physical sweep, in `rumorStore.ts`; the tag rides inside the signed
 * rumor, so a timer change is never retroactive and the tag as signed always
 * governs.
