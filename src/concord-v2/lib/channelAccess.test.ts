/**
 * Read access to a Private Channel, derived from the CORD-04 §2 Role scope

 * computes the same answer from the same folded Roster: a vend on grant and
 * the keep-set of a rekey on revoke are both required of ANY Concord client
 * (CORD-03, CORD-06), so an access list only this client can read is one no
 * other client can honour.
