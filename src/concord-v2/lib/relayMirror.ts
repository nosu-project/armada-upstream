/**
 * Relay mirror — seed newly-adopted relays with the community's history
 * (CORD-02 §6: "a client may optionally rebroadcast old events to a newly
 * adopted relay").
 *
 * A raw relay-to-relay copy of signed wraps, run BEFORE the relay-list edition
 * publishes, so a fresh joiner never lands on a new relay mid-epoch and folds
 * a half-arrived Control Plane. Verbatim events, no re-sealing: a wrap is
 * self-contained and every receiver verifies it exactly as before.
 *
 * What gets mirrored is the CORRECTNESS set — everything a fresh joiner or a
 * catching-up device needs, and nothing more:
 *   - Control Plane, every held epoch (a compaction already folded prior
 *     epochs into the current one, CORD-06);
 *   - Guestbook Plane, every held epoch (the member list);
 *   - rekey addresses between held epochs plus the pending next one, so a
 *     straggler can still walk the continuity chain forward (CORD-06 §2);
 *   - the dissolution address (the grave travels with the community).
 * Chat history stays where it was sent — messages are a property of their era
 * and every member's device holds its own copy.
