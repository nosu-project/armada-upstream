/**
 * Concord V2 stream-key NIP-42 authentication.
 *
 * Every V2 plane is kind-1059 traffic addressed to a DERIVED per-stream pubkey
 * (control, guestbook, per-channel, dissolved, rekey) — never the user's own
 * identity. Relays that gate kind 1059 behind NIP-42 (e.g. ditto-relay's
 * default `AUTH_KINDS=4,1059`) require that EVERY `authors` entry in a
 * kind-1059 REQ be an authenticated pubkey on the connection. The user's login
 * can't satisfy that: the stream address isn't their pubkey.
 *
 * The fix: the client holds the stream SECRET keys (they live in the
 * community_root / channel keys it derives), so it can NIP-42-authenticate AS
 * each stream. This module is the registry of stream keys the client currently
 * holds; {@link NostrProvider}'s AUTH handler signs an extra kind-22242 event
 * per registered key on the same challenge, so the connection ends up
 * authenticated as the user AND every stream it will query.
 *
 * ditto-relay keeps a per-connection SET of authenticated pubkeys and its
 * challenge stays valid for the socket's whole lifetime, so a key registered
 * AFTER the challenge can still authenticate on the live socket — the client
 * just signs and sends another AUTH frame (verified empirically against the
 * real ditto-relay over a live socket). The relay acks every AUTH with
 * `["OK", id, true]`; this module also tracks those acks per relay, giving
 * sweeps a deterministic "these authors are authenticated on this socket"
 * signal instead of a timing heuristic. (The relay processes frames in
 * parallel, so an un-acked AUTH→REQ pipeline can race — hence ack-gating,
 * not send-and-hope.)
 *
 * Keys register with the RELAYS their community lives on, and a challenge
 * signs only the keys scoped to that relay (a key registered without relays is
 * unscoped and signs everywhere — the safe fallback). This matters: a Schnorr
 * signature costs ~4ms (phones 5-10x slower), a multi-community registry holds
 * hundreds of keys, and every socket (re)open earns a fresh challenge —
 * unscoped, one challenge burned 1.5-2s of main-thread signing per relay (see
 * streamAuth.perf.test.ts) for keys the relay would never see queried.
 *
 * Kept out of `concord-v1` and imported by only two shared files
 * (NostrProvider for the WebView's own sockets, useNativeNotifications for
 * the Android service's bridged AUTH challenges) so the V2 tree stays
 * independently deletable.
