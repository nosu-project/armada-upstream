/**
 * Signup step 3: a name and a face, asked for once, at the only moment the
 * user is definitely paying attention.
 *
 * This used to be the full {@link ProfileSettings} editor — the same form
 * Settings renders — which asks a brand-new account about its banner, its
 * website, its lightning address and its custom fields before it has sent a
 * message. Almost every field is one somebody who has been here five seconds
 * has no answer to, and a form that long reads as work to be skipped.
 *
 * So it is Signal's set-up screen instead: one picture, one field, and a way
 * past it. Both are optional and the screen says so — but an account with
 * neither is the account nobody can tell apart from every other new one, and a
 * network of grey circles reads as an empty network even when it is full,
 * which is why there are twelve pictures on the screen and picking one is a
 * single tap. Everything else stays in Settings, where the person filling it
 * in has a reason to.
 *
 * Its own module rather than a fourth body in `signupSteps.tsx`: this one
 * reaches the publish path, the Blossom uploaders and the query cache, none of
 * which the key steps touch, and both consumers' tests would otherwise have to
 * stand all of that up to reach step 2.
